CS/CE 6390 Spring 2012 Homework 2
Eight questions, all count equally.

Question 1 (DVMRP)
==================
Consider the attached figure, consisting of multiple subnets interconnected via 
routers.  The unicast routing protocol finds the shortest path (least number of 
hops) between any pair of nodes. 
 
 (a) In Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB), identify for each LAN, which router is 
 the parent router of the LAN with respect to source S.  
 
 (b) In Truncated Reverse Path Broadcast, indicate which LANs are leaf LANs, 
 and which leaf LANs will be truncated.  
 
 (c) In Reverse Path Multicasting (basically the full-blown DVMRP), identify 
 which routers send Non-Membership Reports, and to whom do they send them.  
 
 (d) After pruning, identify the LANS over which multicast messages from S are 
 sent to group 


Question 2 (DVMRP)
==================
Assume that you are implementing a multicast protocol, as similar to DVMRP as 
possible, except that the underlying unicast protocol is not distance vector 
routing. What part(s) of DVMRP have to be changed, and how?


Question 3 (MOSPF)
===================
Consider again the figure from question 1 above. For MOSPF, show me the cache 
entry that each router would build after the source begins to send multicast 
messages to the group. 

Question 4 (PIM)
================
Consider the shortest-path tree (SPT) for a source S and the rendezvous-point 
tree (RPT). Show an example in which the UNION of the SPT of S and the 
RPT form a loop, and how how PIM would behave under this situation (note that 
the edges of both trees are "directed" edges, their direction is from root to 
leaves).

Question 5 (Interdomain Multicast)
==================================

Two parts, both count equally

a) List all the steps necessary in Interdomain PIM for a receiver to be able to 
receive data from a multicast source along the optimal path from the receiver 
to the source.

b) Assume a router will support both ASM (any source multicast) and also SSM 
(source-specific multicast). Let X be a class D address in the range defined 
for ASM, and Y be a class D address in the range defined for SSM.
        (i) Assume the router receives a message of the form Join(*,X), what 
        should it do with this message?
        (ii) Assume the router receives a message of the form Join(*,Y), what 
        should it do with this message?
        (iii) Assume the router receives a multicast message with source S and 
        destination X. What should it do with this message?
        (iv) Assume the router receives a multicaset message with source S and 
        destination Y. What should it do with this message?


Question 6 (AODV)
=================
Assume that a node X, after not using the routing table entry for a destination 
D, times out and removes D from its routing table (and hence forgets everything 	
about D). In this case, is it possible for a routing loop to be formed? Argue 
why yes or why no (base your answer only on what we have covered about AODV in 
the slides).

Question 7 (DSR)
================
Consider the DSR protocol. Assume that the destination sends back a RRPLY for 
every single RREQ that is received, in an effort to inform the source of all 
possible paths from the source to the destination (links are assumed to be 
bidirectional). Show that even in this case it is possible that the optimum 
(shortest) path from source to destination is never found.

Question 8 (MPLS)
=================
Assume that we are doing MPLS over ATM switches (which are now "label-switching 
routers",  i.e. routers that handle IP but use ATM hardware). Assume that we do 
destination-based forwarding MPLS over these routers. 

    a) Should label-merging or non-label-merging be used? Why?

    b) Assume that ATM cells have a bit in the header, and that reassembly of 
    packets is done as follows: all cells of a packet have 0 in this bit, 
    except the last one, which has a 1 in this bit (i.e. a 1 in the bit marks 
    the last cell in the packet) Under this reassembly method, is there 
    something that switches can do so that label-merging can be used?
